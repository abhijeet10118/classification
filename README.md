# classification
This repository contains a hands-on implementation of the core concepts from the Classification chapter of Aurélien Géron's book, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow". Using the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this project walks through building, training, and evaluating various classification models.
