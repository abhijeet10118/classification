# classification
This repository contains a hands-on implementation of the core concepts from the Classification chapter of Aur√©lien G√©ron's book, "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; TensorFlow". Using the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this project walks through building, training, and evaluating various classification models.
‚ú® What I Learned
Fundamental to Advanced Evaluation: Move beyond simple accuracy to master robust evaluation techniques like cross-validation, precision/recall analysis, and ROC curves.

Effective Error Analysis: Learn to diagnose your model's mistakes by visualizing confusion matrices and inspecting misclassified examples.

Strategic Model Selection: Understand the trade-offs between different classifiers, like SGD and Random Forest, and how to compare them effectively.

Practical Preprocessing: See the dramatic impact of feature scaling on model performance.

Diverse Classification Strategies: Implement binary, multiclass, and even multioutput classifiers to solve different kinds of problems.

Key Concepts and Techniques Implemented
This project provides code examples for the following machine learning concepts:

üéØ 1. Binary Classification
Training a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier to act as a "5-detector," distinguishing one digit from all others.

üìä 2. Performance Evaluation & Metrics
Measuring performance using K-fold cross-validation with cross_val_score.

Analyzing model behavior with a Confusion Matrix.

Understanding the trade-offs between Precision and Recall.

Visualizing performance with the Precision-Recall Curve and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve.

Summarizing model skill with the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) score.

ü•ä 3. Model Comparison
Training a RandomForestClassifier and comparing its ROC curve directly against the SGDClassifier to demonstrate performance differences.

üî¢ 4. Multiclass Classification
Training models to classify all 10 digits (0-9).

Implementing the One-vs-One (OvO) strategy with an SGD classifier.

The importance of feature scaling (StandardScaler) for improving model accuracy.

üßê 5. Advanced Error Analysis
Visualizing the multiclass confusion matrix to identify systemic errors.

Normalizing the confusion matrix to highlight error rates.

Drilling down into specific, common errors (e.g., the confusion between '3' and '5') by visually inspecting the misclassified digits.

üßº 6. Multioutput Classification
Building a simple image denoising system using a KNeighborsClassifier to demonstrate a model with multiple outputs (one for each pixel).

üñºÔ∏è Dataset
This project uses the MNIST dataset, fetched directly via Scikit-Learn's fetch_openml('mnist_784').

How to Use
This repository is intended as a learning tool. You can clone the repository and run the code in a Jupyter Notebook or a similar environment to follow along with the concepts presented in the book. Each section corresponds to a key topic in the classification chapter.
